# move_deactivated_servers

This Python script will move deactivated servers contained in the
Halo Group tree scope of the API Key specified into a specified
group based on number of days the server has been in a deactivated
state.

This will help cloud forward customers with highly elastic environments
keep their active server groups clean. Also this will allow for the issues
per group reports to contain information for only active or recently
deactivated servers and prevent reporting on systems that are no longer
online or active.

IMPORTANT:
This script was built for Python 2.7.11 or later and requires an OpenSSL
version compatible with TLS1.2 or newer
Check python OpenSSL version

  >python

  >then run "import ssl"

  >then run "ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION"

Should show something similar to:
'OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016'


Python Module Prerequisites:
This script requires the following Python modules:
json, base64, datetime, sys, argparse, pytz, requests, iso8601
Use PIP to install these if you are encountering errors for missing modules
for pytz, requests, iso8601
   > pip install requests, pytz, iso8601

The script takes advantage of the new server field last_state_change and
is intended to be run from cron on a restricted-access tools server or
bastion box once daily.  Since last_state_change is only expressed in whole
days after a server has been offline for more than 24 hours, there is little
advantage to running it more often.

You will need a config.py file that includes your API key and secret key
-- see the sample file. The keypair must have full access (read-write), and
as always, you will want to protect the security

By default, servers that have been deactivated for more than 7 days will be
moved by the script to the specified group. To change this, modify the value
of deactivate_num_days in the config.py file.
